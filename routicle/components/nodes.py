Defination of a Node Attributes ("Point of Interest") for a Gaph

A node for supply chain and logistics problem is subclassified into
multiple types based on requirement. The definaion and attributes are
defined. The attributes are typical constraints like supply/demand for
a particular node type, for example a plant or an warehouse.

    A Storage Unit is a Location of Storage, Base Class with Defaults

    A storage unit can be any storage locations; like ports,
    warehouses, etc. and typically has an constraint around capacity
    which is the default attribute of the base :class:`PointOfInterest`
    as already defined. The storage location class can accept any
    attributes which may be helpful in further development.

    This type of node (when ``u``) often requires a time and a cost
    for storage and transfer from and to one location to another. Check
    :class:`TimeCostEdge` for more information.

    Usage Example(s)
    ----------------

    A storage unit may have certain additional attributes defined to
    further enhance the model like:

    .. code-block:: python

        storage = StorageUnits(storageCost = XX)
        print(storage.storageCost)
        >> XX

    However, this is currently not in the scope of development and may
    be refined externally.
