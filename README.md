Efficient inventory management is a critical component of a company's supply chain operations. Poor inventory decisions can
lead to stockouts, excess holding costs, and ultimately, a loss in customer satisfaction and profitability. Companies dealing
with fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), manufacturing, retail, or e-commerce must carefully balance the supply and demand across
multiple nodes in their distribution network, such as plants, warehouses, distributors, and retail outlets.
